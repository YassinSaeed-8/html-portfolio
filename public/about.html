<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi, my name is <strong>Yassin Saeed</strong>, and I’m a Computer Science bachelor’s student at the Egyptian Russian University. Alongside my studies, I’ve been building my skills in different areas of programming and development. I started out learning C++ and Python, where I worked on projects like a simple ticket reservation system in C++ and a bingo game in Python, which helped me grow both my problem-solving abilities and my love for coding. Over time, I discovered my passion for web development, and I’ve been diving deep into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create functional and user-friendly websites. My goal is to combine this technical knowledge with continuous learning to become both a skilled web developer and a well-rounded software engineer. </p> <p> Beyond the screen, football plays a huge role in my life. I’m not only a big fan of the game but also a professional player, and pursuing football is one of my biggest dreams alongside my passion for coding. I’ve always believed that the discipline, teamwork, and persistence I learn from sports directly influence how I approach programming challenges—whether it’s debugging an error, solving complex problems, or bringing an app idea to life. I’d describe myself as 70% logical and 30% creative, which allows me to find smart solutions while also adding a personal touch to my projects. For me, coding and football aren’t just activities—they’re both journeys of growth, passion, and pushing myself to new limits. </p>
